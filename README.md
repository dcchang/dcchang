## Hi, welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer working towards a career in computational biology. I studied biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan, and since graduating, I have been developing machine learning models for antibiotic drug combination screening. I am also building a Next.js investing application with the goal of gaining experience in web developmeent and general software engineering.

Long-term, my goal is to become a great machine learning engineer and to take part in endeavors that are fun and inspiring. I would love to work on robotic technologies, or work on applications that advance the development of genetic engineering. My big dream is to help colonize Mars and assist in efforts towards manned deep-space exploration.
