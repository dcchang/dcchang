# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm David Chang

## Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a software engineer working towards a career in computational biology. I studied biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan, and since graduating, I have been developing machine learning models for antibiotic drug combination screening. I am also building an investing web application for people to share market sentiment and learn about the stock market.

I aim to continue to apply myself towards data science problems in biology and medicine, and to develop the computational skills and foundations needed for a successful career as a machine learning engineer. I am also continuing to improve my skills in full-stack web development.

Long-term, I would love to work on robotic technologies, or work on applications that advance the development of genetic engineering. My dream is to help colonize Mars and assist in efforts towards manned deep-space exploration. The road ahead is rife with uncertainty and ever-changing conditions, but no matter the circumstances, I'm determined to become a great engineer.
